This PR adds unit tests for applyFixes, a CI workflow to run lint and unit tests, a lightweight dev server for local dev that correctly serves .mjs with text/javascript, and robust fixes to js/app.js (mermaid.render compatibility, tolerant DOM selection, safer autofix behaviour).

Notes:
- package.json now contains "type": "module" (ESM). Please verify this is compatible with your deployment/build.
- ESLint reports some warnings about unused variables; these are warnings only.

How to test locally:
1. npm install
2. npm run test:ci
3. npm run dev (open http://localhost:8000/index.html)

Files changed:
- modified: js/app.js, package.json, eslint.config.js
- added: .github/workflows/ci.yml, test/unit/applyFixes.test.mjs, scripts/dev-server.mjs, patches/*

If you prefer different naming/behaviour (e.g. keep repo as CommonJS), I can revert the "type: module" change and adapt the tests to run under CommonJS.
