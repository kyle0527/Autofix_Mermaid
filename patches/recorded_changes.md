# Recorded Changes

- Date: 2025-09-16
- Author: automated-assistant (recorded by the assistant per user request)

## Changes applied

1. File modified: `js/app.js`
   - Change summary: Adjusted `render()` to avoid forcibly overwriting the editor on each render, surfaced `applyFixes` notes into the `errors` panel, and made `mermaid.render` result handling robust to accept either a string (svg) or an object `{ svg }`.
   - Patch file (non-applied suggestion): `patches/suggested_js_app_patch.diff` (created prior to applying changes).

## Verification

## Rationale

## Next recommended actions

## Files created/edited during this session
- Review `autofix.js`, `layout.js`, and `sanitize.js` for any API usage that needs harmonizing. (A cursory read was performed and no immediate `mermaid.render` calls were found inside those files; main changes were in `js/app.js`.)
